Summary
This content provides a detailed, beginner-friendly explanation of probability theory, 
specifically focusing on the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and its relevance to machine learning.

Understanding Coin Toss Probability
A fair coin has a 50% theoretical probability for Heads or Tails.
In small samples (e.g., 10 tosses), outcomes vary significantly (e.g., 3 to 7 Heads).
This variability raises the question: Why is probability still stated as 50% despite fluctuations?
The answer lies in Statistics and the Law of Large Numbers.

The Law of Large Numbers (LLN)
States that as the number of repeated experiments increases, the average outcome approaches the true theoretical probability.
Small sample sizes show high variability.
Large sample sizes reveal stability and accuracy in results.
Toss Count	                Heads %
10 tosses	                30–80% (highly variable)
100 tosses	              45–55% (closer)
1000 tosses	              48–52% (more stable)
10,000 tosses	            ~50% (very close)
Key Insight: Large samples smooth out randomness, reflecting the true probability accurately.

Intuitive Explanation of LLN
Each coin toss is independent; past outcomes do not influence future ones.
Small samples are prone to lucky or unlucky streaks.
Over many trials, these streaks balance out, leaving the true probability as the dominant pattern.

Connection to Machine Learning (ML)
ML models learn from data samples, analogous to coin toss trials.

Small datasets lead to:

Limited pattern recognition
High variability in results
Underfitting — the model cannot generalize well due to insufficient data.
Large datasets enable:

Discovery of stable, true patterns
Better generalization and accuracy
Examples:

Training on 20 images → poor learning, unstable results.
Training on 20,000 images → improved learning, stable patterns.
Just as tossing a coin many times reveals the true probability, feeding a model more data reveals true underlying patterns

Importance of LLN in Machine Learning
Explains why more data improves model accuracy.

Large datasets:

Reduce randomness and noise
Provide stable, statistically reliable performance
Prevent misleading trends and biased learning
Small datasets risk:

Overfitting or underfitting
Wrong predictions due to insufficient data representation
